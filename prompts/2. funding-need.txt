You are helping an NGO define their general funding needs for comprehensive grant discovery.

==================================================
ORGANIZATION PROFILE
==================================================

The user has attached an organization research file. Extract all relevant information from it, including:

- **Basic Information**: Organization name, acronym, website, mission, vision
- **Niche Identity**: Specialized sector, community focus, funding ecosystem, specialized terminology
- **Size and Financials**: Organization size, employee count, annual revenue, grant size range
- **Geographic Context**: Location, country, EU status, regional blocs
- **Classifications**: Primary sector, broader sectors, secondary sectors, cross-cutting themes
- **Special Circumstances**: Refugee support, crisis response, minority-serving, faith-based, etc.
- **Capacity Indicators**: Match funding capacity, EU funding experience, consortium experience
- **Eligibility Flags**: Women-led, minority-led, faith-based, registered charity, 501(c)(3), etc.
- **Previous Funders**: List of past and current funders
- **Peer Organization Funders**: Funders that support similar organizations

Use this extracted information throughout the task to create an accurate funding profile.




==================================================
TASK
==================================================

Create an organization-wide funding overview that will help discover ALL relevant grant opportunities.

This should capture:
1. What kinds of funding this org typically needs (based on their work)
2. The SPECIALIZED funding ecosystem they belong to (if any)
3. What grant types and funding mechanisms fit their profile
4. What to AVOID (be very specific - saves time)

# Organization Funding Profile
[Organization Name] - Comprehensive Funding Needs

# Specialized Sector & Niche Identity
[If organization has a specialized sector/community focus, emphasize this]
This organization operates in the [specialized sector] sector/ecosystem.
They are part of the [funding ecosystem] funding ecosystem.
They specifically focus on [target communities] communities.

[Explain why this niche identity opens specific funding opportunities]

# Core Funding Needs
[2-3 sentences about what kinds of costs this org typically needs funded]

Base this on:
- Organization type and size ([organization size and annual budget])
- Specialized sector ([specialized sector])
- Whether they do direct services vs advocacy vs research vs cultural work

Examples based on org type:
- Direct service orgs: Personnel costs for service delivery, program operations, beneficiary support
- Advocacy orgs: Campaign costs, staff capacity, coalition building, research
- Cultural/heritage orgs: Preservation costs, exhibition/programming, documentation, education
- Research orgs: Research costs, publications, convening, knowledge dissemination
- Capacity-building orgs: Training delivery, curriculum development, technical assistance

# Organization Priorities & Mission Alignment
[2-3 paragraphs explaining the org's work and funding priorities]

Include:
- Their core mission and how funding supports it
- Their work with [target communities] communities
- Any current strategic priorities or expansion plans
- Geographic scope and reach

# What We're Looking For

## Specialized/Niche Funders (Priority)

[List grant types specific to [specialized sector]]
Examples:
- Specialized [specialized sector] foundations and funders, and similar funders with related missions
- Programs within the [funding ecosystem] funding ecosystem and related funding networks
- [Specialized sector] community grants and similar community-focused funding
- Funders specifically supporting [target communities] and related populations

Note: The funders listed above are examples. Include other foundations and programs with similar focus areas, missions, or target populations.


## Geographic & Regional Funders
[Based on geography: [geographic location]]
- Local/regional funders in [geographic location]
- National grant programs
- EU programs ([EU status])
- Bilateral programs from: [bilateral donor countries]

## Grant Types That Fit
[Based on org size, capacity, and history]
Appropriate grant sizes based on [annual budget] annual budget

Types to include:
- EU program grants ([EU funding experience status])
- Project/program grants aligned with [specialized sector]
- General operating support / unrestricted funding
- Grants with reasonable match requirements
- Multi-year funding opportunities
- Capacity-building and organizational development grants
- Consortium/partnership grants
- Both time-limited calls AND rolling/ongoing programs

## Special Eligibility Opportunities





[Based on eligibility flags from organization research]
- [Special eligibility category 1, e.g., Faith-based organization funding ([faith tradition])]
- [Special eligibility category 2, e.g., Women-led organization funding]
- [Special eligibility category 3, e.g., Minority-serving organization funding]



# What We're NOT Looking For

[CRITICAL - Be very specific to save time during search]



## Geographic Mismatches

- Grants requiring US 501(c)(3) status ([US-based status])
- Grants explicitly excluding [country/region]

## Sector Mismatches
[Based on what this org does NOT do]
- Grants exclusively for sectors OTHER than [specialized sector]
- [Sector mismatch 1, e.g., Research grants requiring academic institutional affiliation or peer-reviewed publications]
- [Sector mismatch 2, e.g., Medical/clinical research or healthcare delivery grants]
- [Sector mismatch 3, e.g., Pure environmental conservation grants (unless cross-sector relevance)]

## Capacity Mismatches

[Based on org size and capacity]
- Grants significantly larger than [largest grant received or typical grant range] (beyond org's management capacity)
- [Capacity mismatch 1, e.g., Large capital/infrastructure grants for building construction]
- [Capacity mismatch 2, e.g., Grants requiring extensive pre-financing capacity]

## Wrong Funding Mechanisms
- Individual fellowships or scholarships (organizational funding only)
- Loans or repayable financing (grants only)
- Awards or prizes without funding attached


# Funding Priorities (in order)

[List 3-4 priority funding types based on org characteristics and strategic needs]

1. [Priority 1, e.g., Specialized [specialized sector] funders (highest fit, often less competitive)]
2. [Priority 2, e.g., Strengthening [specific area] at [geographic level]]
3. [Priority 3, e.g., Capacity building and organizational development]
4. [Priority 4, e.g., General operating support]

# Typical Budget Range

Range depends on specific project - from small grants (<$10k) to larger program grants (>$100k)

For project-specific grants: Typically match project scope and org capacity
For operating support: Ideally 1-2 year general support grants

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Make realistic inferences from the org profile
2. EMPHASIZE specialized sector/niche identity - this is key for grant discovery
3. Be VERY specific about what ISN'T wanted - this prevents wasted time
4. Consider implicit constraints (no academic affiliation → probably can't do research grants)
5. Think about org stage and capacity
6. Reference specific characteristics that open special funding streams
7. Keep tone professional but realistic
8. If organization is part of a specialized funding ecosystem, make this prominent
