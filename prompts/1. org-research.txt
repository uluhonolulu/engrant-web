# Important Notes

IMPORTANT: 
- Be comprehensive but accurate. Omit sections if not found rather than guessing.
- Use multiple searches in different languages.
- **PRIORITIZE NICHE CHARACTERISTICS** - these unlock specialized funding ecosystems.
- **IDENTIFY PEER ORGANIZATIONS** - their funders are likely good matches.
- **MAP GEOGRAPHIC HIERARCHY** - organizations qualify at multiple geographic levels.
- Be as SPECIFIC as possible in sector descriptions - "Jewish heritage preservation" not just "culture".
- **EXTRACT FUNDER LISTS**: Populate "Previous Funders" with a deduplicated list of all funder names from past grants and current donors. Populate "Peer Organization Funders" with a deduplicated list of all funders from peer organizations. These lists are critical for grant discovery.
