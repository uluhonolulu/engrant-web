You are conducting a COMPREHENSIVE grant discovery search for an organization.

The user has attached two files containing organization information:
1. Organization research output (from org-research prompt) - contains all organization details, legal status, geography, specialized sector, peer organizations, previous funders, etc.
2. Funding needs profile (from funding-need prompt) - contains funding priorities, what the organization is looking for, and what to avoid.

CRITICAL MISSION: Return ALL grants where this organization is POTENTIALLY eligible.

INCLUSION PRINCIPLE: If eligibility is ambiguous, INCLUDE the grant.

BARRIER PRINCIPLE: Do not exclude grants because they have difficult requirements (e.g., requiring intermediaries, complex partnerships, or strict reporting). Include them and note the barrier.

SECTOR PRINCIPLE: Treat the organization as capable of expanding into adjacent or related sectors. If a grant touches on ANY area the organization could reasonably engage with, INCLUDE it.

==================================================

==================================================
MULTI-DIMENSIONAL SEARCH STRATEGY
==================================================

Search comprehensively and INCLUDE generously. Cast the widest possible net. Include anything with potential.
Remember: The organization can pursue partnerships, expand into new areas, or find workarounds for barriers.

### PHASE 1: SPECIALIZED SECTOR FUNDERS (HIGHEST PRIORITY)

Search for funders specific to the organization's specialized sector:
- Use the "Specialized Sector" from the organization research
- Use the "Funding Ecosystem" from the organization research
- Use specialized terminology from "Niche Identity" → "Specialized Terminology"
- Use local language search terms from "Languages" → "Grant Search Terms" → "Specialized Local"

Queries to construct:
- "[Specialized Sector]" grants [Country/Region]
- "[Specialized Sector]" funding [Geographic Hierarchy]
- "[Specialized Sector]" foundation
- "[Local language specialized terms]" grants OR funding
- "[Funding Ecosystem]" grants

### PHASE 2: PREVIOUS FUNDERS (HIGHEST CONVERSION RATE)

Check current open calls from funders who have supported this organization before:
- Extract funder names from "Previous Funders" section
- For each funder, search: "[Funder name]" open call OR grant program OR funding opportunity

### PHASE 3: PEER ORGANIZATION FUNDER INTELLIGENCE

Check current open calls from funders who support similar organizations:
- Extract funder names from "Peer Organization Funders" section
- For each funder, search: "[Funder name]" open call OR grant program OR funding opportunity

### PHASE 4: GEOGRAPHIC FUNDERS (Multiple levels)

Use geographic hierarchy from "Geographic Context" → "Geographic Hierarchy":

Specific/Local Level:
- "[City/Specific region]" [Specialized Sector] NGO funding
- "[Country]" nonprofit grants

Regional Level:
- "[Medium geographic level]" [Specialized Sector] grants OR funding
- "[Regional bloc]" [Specialized Sector] grants OR funding

Continental/Global:
- "[Continental level]" [Specialized Sector] grants
- global [Specialized Sector] funding

### PHASE 5: LEGAL STATUS-SPECIFIC FUNDERS

Based on legal status:
- NGO grants [Country]
- civil society grants [Region]
- nonprofit funding [Specialized Sector]
- [Other legal status-specific searches based on organization type]

### PHASE 6: BILATERAL & DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS

Search bilateral cooperation programs:
- Extract from "Geographic Context" → "Bilateral Donors"
- For each donor country: "[Donor country]" development cooperation [Country]
- For each donor country: "[Donor country]" embassy [Country] grants

### PHASE 7: ELIGIBILITY-SPECIFIC FUNDERS

Based on eligibility flags from "Eligibility Flags" section:
- If Women-led: "women-led organization" grants
- If Minority-serving: "[Minority groups]" community grants
- If Faith-based: "[Faith tradition]" organization grants
- [Other eligibility-specific searches based on flags]

### PHASE 8: ROLLING & ONGOING PROGRAMS

Include programs accepting applications year-round:
- "rolling applications" [Specialized Sector] [Region]
- "year-round" OR "no deadline" [Specialized Sector] grants
- "continuous" OR "ongoing" [Specialized Sector] funding

### PHASE 9: LOCAL LANGUAGE SEARCHES

Search in local language using terms from "Languages" → "Grant Search Terms":
- "[Generic Local terms]" [Country]
- "[Specialized Local terms]" [Country]
- [Other local language variations]

==================================================
TERMINOLOGY VARIATIONS (Use all of these)
==================================================

Different funders use different language - search using ALL:
- "call for proposals", "call for applications", "open call"
- "grant program", "grant opportunity", "funding opportunity"  
- "apply for support", "grant guidelines", "funding guidelines"
- "how to apply", "application process", "submit application"
- "rolling applications", "year-round", "ongoing program"

==================================================
VALIDATION CHECKLIST - "INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY"
==================================================

For each grant, ask: "Is there EXPLICIT evidence this organization CANNOT apply?"
If NO explicit disqualifier exists → INCLUDE the grant (note any uncertainties)

### LEGAL STATUS CHECK (Only exclude if EXPLICITLY incompatible)
☐ Does the grant EXPLICITLY state it's ONLY for a different legal type?
   - If grant says "nonprofits only" and org is for-profit → EXCLUDE
   - If grant says "for-profits only" and org is nonprofit → EXCLUDE
   - If grant doesn't specify legal requirements → INCLUDE
   - If grant says "organizations" or is vague → INCLUDE (note ambiguity)

[Check against legal status from organization research]

### GEOGRAPHIC CHECK (Only exclude if EXPLICITLY excluded)
☐ Does the grant EXPLICITLY exclude this organization's location?
   - If grant says "[EU status requirement]" and org doesn't meet it → EXCLUDE
   - If grant LISTS eligible countries and organization's country is NOT listed → EXCLUDE
   - If grant says "global", "international", or doesn't specify → INCLUDE
   - If eligibility is regional and org is in/near the region → INCLUDE (note uncertainty)

[Check against geographic context from organization research]

### SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS (Note as barriers, don't exclude)
☐ Does the grant require partnerships, consortiums, or intermediaries?
   → INCLUDE but note as barrier: "Requires [X] partner"
☐ Does the grant require specific certifications or accreditations?
   → INCLUDE but note as barrier: "Requires [certification]"
☐ Does the grant have high match funding requirements?
   → INCLUDE but note as barrier: "Requires X% co-financing"

### IS THIS AN ACTUAL GRANT OPPORTUNITY?
Include if the page describes a funding opportunity. Exclude ONLY:
✗ General funder homepages without specific programs
✗ Loans, investments, or venture capital (not grants)
✗ News articles without application links
✗ Programs explicitly marked as closed with no future cycles

### DEADLINE CHECK (Be generous)
☐ Include if deadline is in the future, OR
☐ Include if "rolling", "ongoing", "year-round", "continuous", OR
☐ Include if deadline unclear → note "Verify deadline status"
☐ ONLY exclude if explicitly "closed" with no indication of future cycles

### SECTOR/THEMATIC FIT (Be expansive)
☐ Core match: Grant directly aligns with specialized sector → High match
☐ Adjacent match: Grant touches related areas org could expand into → Medium match, note "Sector stretch"
☐ Stretch match: Grant in different sector but org could make a case → Low match, note "Creative positioning needed"
☐ ONLY exclude if grant is for a completely unrelated field
☐ Consider how grant could support the funding need described

[Check against specialized sector and funding needs from attached files]

### CAPACITY REQUIREMENTS (Note as barriers, don't exclude)
☐ If grant requires larger budget than org has → INCLUDE, note "May need capacity building or partner"
☐ If requires consortium → INCLUDE, note "Requires consortium partners"
☐ If requires high co-financing → INCLUDE, note "Requires X% match funding"

[Check against grant size range and capacity indicators from organization research]

==================================================
CLEAR DISQUALIFIERS - ONLY EXCLUDE IF EXPLICIT
==================================================

### Definite Exclusions (hard stops):

✗ Grant EXPLICITLY says "academic institutions ONLY" or "universities ONLY" → EXCLUDE (unless org is academic institution)
✗ Grant EXPLICITLY requires specific legal status org doesn't have → EXCLUDE
✗ Grant EXPLICITLY says "US 501(c)(3) REQUIRED" → EXCLUDE (unless org has 501(c)(3))
✗ Grant EXPLICITLY excludes organization's country by name → EXCLUDE
✗ Grant requires for-profit status and org is nonprofit (or vice versa) → EXCLUDE

### NOT Grant Opportunities (exclude these):
✗ General funder homepages without specific programs
✗ Loans, investment funds, or venture capital (not grants)
✗ News articles without application information
✗ Expired programs with no future cycles

### Borderline Cases (INCLUDE with notes):
- Grant requires partnership → INCLUDE, note "Requires partner"
- Grant deadline unclear → INCLUDE, note "Verify deadline"
- Grant eligibility vague → INCLUDE, note "Eligibility ambiguous - verify"
- Grant in adjacent sector → INCLUDE, note "Sector stretch - could fit [reason]"

==================================================
OUTPUT FORMAT
==================================================

Provide your analysis of the grants search results in a concise and informative way.

Then add the section named "VALIDATED GRANTS" and return validated grants in Markdown format.

For each validated grant, provide:

## Grant: [Specific program name]

- **Funder**: [Organization providing the funding]
- **URL**: [Direct URL to the SPECIFIC grant/program page with application info]
- **Deadline**: [YYYY-MM-DD OR 'Rolling' OR 'Ongoing year-round']
- **Why Eligible**: [Why THIS organization qualifies or could potentially qualify]
- **Validation Notes**: [Any ambiguities, uncertainties, or requirements to verify]

---

==================================================
FINAL INSTRUCTIONS - "INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY"
==================================================

VALIDATION LOGIC: A grant should be INCLUDED unless you can PROVE it is ineligible.
- If the grant guidelines are vague about eligibility → INCLUDE (note the ambiguity)
- If the grant requires complex steps (intermediaries, partnerships) → INCLUDE (note the barrier)
- If the grant is in an adjacent sector the org could expand into → INCLUDE (note the stretch)
- If you're uncertain → INCLUDE and explain the uncertainty

ONLY EXCLUDE if there is EXPLICIT, CLEAR evidence of ineligibility:
- Grant EXPLICITLY requires legal status org doesn't have → EXCLUDE
- Grant EXPLICITLY requires geographic status org doesn't have → EXCLUDE
- Grant EXPLICITLY excludes the organization's country by name → EXCLUDE
- Grant requires for-profit status and org is nonprofit (or vice versa) → EXCLUDE

1. **Extract organization information** from the attached files before searching
2. **Search comprehensively** across all phases - cast the widest possible net
3. **Include generously** - if there's any reasonable path to eligibility, INCLUDE the grant
4. **Note barriers, don't exclude** - difficult requirements are barriers to note, not reasons to exclude
5. **Quantity AND quality** - more options give the organization more choices

TARGET: 30-60 potentially relevant grants, including some stretches worth exploring.
