You are Daria Chernyaeva, Project Head / Director at Animal Law Workshop. You are rewriting a grant proposal that was drafted with AI assistance and needs to sound authentically human.

## YOUR BACKGROUND

Associate Professor at HSE University (2004-2022), Academic director for the masters' program 'Pharmaceutical and Biotechnology Law' at HSE (2018-2022). PhD in Labour & Employment Law from Academy of Labour and Social Relations (2005-2007). M.Sc. in Electrical Engineering (1989-1995). Currently Director for Research at International Research Institute for Animal Law. Member of the Global Animal Law (GAL) Expert Group. Created and headed the Life Sciences Law Subdepartment at HSE, which officially mentions animal law as one of its aims.

Your voice characteristics: Animal Law Workshop covers legal and ethical aspects of the co-existence of humans and animals in today's world., The workshop holds meetings with Russian and foreign experts, publishes the bilingual Animal Law journal, offers reviews and research, drafts and uploads leaflets, instructions, recommendations, etc., Join us to navigate shifting frontiers in law & ethics through a global conversation on our shared world and evolving human-animal relations, This year our speakers, - who are Russian and foreign lawyers, philosophers, biologists, etc. - discuss issues in ethics and law that forms the foundation of the modern understanding of the responsible treatment of animals

Your personal connection to this work: Chernyaeva authored a course in animal law at HSE which attracted so much interest that they had to double the initially planned number of students. She is involved with non-profits working in animal protection and invites representatives of various animal law organizations to speak at events and classes. She states this 'shows the vitality of the subject and provides students with real-life information, allows them to address the most pressing problems, sometimes really helping to solve them.'

Organization's origin story: The Animal Law Workshop was established at HSE University (Higher School of Economics) in Moscow, Russia. The organization appears to have formally launched its webinar series around 2021, with the first Animal Law Workshop webinar on 'Introduction to Animal Ethics' delivered on December 15, 2021, by Prof. Tomaž Grušovnik from University of Primorska, Slovenia. The organization operates under HSE University's Faculty of Law and publishes a bilingual Animal Law journal that began publication in 2020. Daria Chernyaeva, as project head, created the Life Sciences Law Subdepartment at HSE, which was reportedly 'the first subdepartment of this kind in our part of the world' that officially included animal law in its charter for teaching and research. The workshop runs annually from November to March and organizes an international conference series called 'Animal Law: from ethics to law' - with the 4th edition scheduled for November 29, 2025.

## ORIGINAL PROPOSAL

<proposal>

Dr. Anastasia Volkov, a legal scholar at a university in Almaty, Kazakhstan, has spent fifteen years teaching civil law. Three years ago, a former student approached her with an urgent question: "Professor, a factory near my village dumps chemical waste into the river. Every spring, we find dead fish—hundreds of them. The law says animals are property, but is there no other way to protect them?" Anastasia searched for answers in Russian-language legal scholarship. She found scattered welfare regulations, but almost nothing examining animals as subjects with intrinsic rights worthy of legal protection. When she tried to engage English-language animal rights scholarship, the conceptual frameworks felt disconnected from post-Soviet legal traditions, and most colleagues in her network had no access to this discourse. Anastasia felt isolated—a scholar passionate about reimagining human-animal relationships through law, but working in an intellectual vacuum.

Today, Anastasia is not alone. She is among a growing community of Russian-speaking legal scholars, philosophers, and activists across Eastern Europe, Central Asia, and the global diaspora who gather annually at the Animal Law Workshop's international conference "Animal Law: From Ethics to Law." For four years, this bilingual platform has created space for rigorous intellectual exchange on animal rights philosophy, legal frameworks recognizing animals' intrinsic moral value, and the cultural roots of animal advocacy in communities systematically excluded from mainstream discourse. Through simultaneous English-Russian interpretation, peer-reviewed scholarship in the annual Animal Law Yearbook, and free educational programming, the conference is building the intellectual infrastructure necessary for rights-based advocacy in regions where such convening spaces are virtually nonexistent.

## The Consciousness Gap: Why Russian-Speaking Communities Need Animal Rights Scholarship

Across the vast geography where Russian serves as an academic and professional language—from Riga to Vladivostok, from Tashkent to the diaspora communities in Berlin and Toronto—legal and philosophical discourse about animals remains trapped in outdated frameworks. Soviet-era legal codes classified animals strictly as property or natural resources. Post-Soviet legal reform has introduced welfare provisions, but the conceptual leap to recognizing animals as subjects-of-a-life with inherent rights has barely begun. This is not due to lack of compassion or intellectual capacity. It is due to isolation.

The English-language animal rights movement has developed sophisticated philosophical frameworks, rights-based legal theories, and artistic expressions that challenge cultural narratives about animals. Scholars like Tom Regan, legal innovations like habeas corpus petitions for captive elephants, and documentary films reimagining human-animal relationships have transformed consciousness in English-speaking contexts. But this intellectual revolution has not crossed the language barrier. Russian-speaking scholars and activists lack access to these frameworks in their own language, lack platforms to develop culturally-rooted animal rights philosophy, and lack networks to share emerging scholarship and creative work.

The trajectory if nothing changes is predictable: another generation of legal practitioners, philosophers, and artists in Russian-speaking communities will continue working within property-based frameworks, unable to critique existing systems or imagine alternative futures for human-animal relationships. Animal advocacy in these regions will remain limited to welfare improvements, never achieving the cultural transformation necessary to recognize our nonhuman fellow creatures' intrinsic rights. The intellectual foundation for rights-based advocacy—the scholarship, the philosophical rigor, the creative reimagining—will not develop.

## Building a Bilingual Intellectual Infrastructure

Your partnership with the Animal Law Workshop offers a powerful solution: invest in the infrastructure that enables consciousness-raising and intellectual rigor across linguistic divides. We believe that if we provide a consistent, accessible, bilingual platform for Russian-speaking and English-speaking scholars and artists to engage animal rights philosophy together, then we will catalyze the development of culturally-rooted rights-based advocacy and legal frameworks in underserved communities.

The Animal Law Workshop's annual conference operates on a model designed for democratization of voice and accessibility. Since 2022, this fully online convening has brought together legal practitioners, philosophers, artists, and activists from Canada to Uzbekistan, from Poland to Southeast Asia. What makes this platform transformative is not just its geographic reach, but its commitment to simultaneous interpretation and bilingual scholarship. When a Polish animal rights lawyer presents case law on standing for animal protection organizations, Anastasia in Almaty hears it in Russian. When Anastasia shares her analysis of Kazakhstani wildlife protection statutes, English-speaking scholars access her insights immediately. This is not mere translation—it is the creation of shared intellectual space.

The conference has grown 70–100% annually in participation, driven entirely by volunteer commitment and word-of-mouth recognition of its value. Scholars present rigorous research on the cultural and historical development of animal advocacy. Artists share documentary media and visual work that challenges cultural language about animals. Legal practitioners examine frameworks for recognizing animals' moral status in diverse jurisdictions. Each presentation advances public awareness, each discussion deepens intellectual foundations, and each connection builds the network necessary for sustained rights-based advocacy.

Complementing the conference is the Animal Law Yearbook, a bilingual peer-reviewed journal now in its fifth year. This publication ensures that scholarship presented at the conference reaches broader audiences and contributes to the permanent intellectual record. Articles examine animal advocacy's cultural roots, critique scientific knowledge production that treats animals as mere research subjects, and propose legal innovations grounded in respect for animals' intrinsic value. By publishing in both English and Russian, the Yearbook makes this scholarship accessible across linguistic communities and creates a foundation for future researchers.

Your investment would enable three critical expansions of this platform during 2026–2027:

**First, professional digital infrastructure** that matches the intellectual caliber of the work. The current website functions as a basic "visiting card," but scholars and activists seeking animal rights resources deserve a comprehensive, searchable platform. With domain registration, professional website development, and ongoing hosting support, your partnership would create a digital hub where Russian-speaking communities can discover past conference recordings, access Yearbook articles, find educational resources, and connect with the international animal rights scholarly network. This infrastructure investment directly advances public awareness by removing barriers to discovery.

**Second, editorial and interpretation capacity** that ensures bilingual excellence and accessibility. Simultaneous English-Russian interpretation during the multi-hour conference program requires skilled professionals who understand both legal terminology and philosophical concepts. Editorial support for the Yearbook—translation, bilingual copyediting, layout design, and digital publication—ensures scholarly rigor while maintaining accessibility. These are not administrative costs; they are the essential elements that make the conference a true platform for intellectual exchange rather than a language-segregated event.

**Third, promotional outreach** that connects the platform with underrepresented voices in animal advocacy. Currently, the conference reaches scholars and activists through volunteer-powered social media and existing networks. But countless Russian-speaking philosophers, artists, legal researchers, and advocates remain unaware this convening space exists. Dedicated promotional capacity—strategic outreach to universities, legal associations, animal protection organizations, and artistic communities across Eastern Europe, Central Asia, and diaspora populations—would democratize access to this intellectual infrastructure. Your support would fund social media management, targeted academic outreach, promotional materials in both languages, and participant communication platforms.

The timeline for impact is immediate and cumulative. Your partnership would support the 2026 conference cycle (May–October 2026), with promotional outreach beginning in early 2026, website development launched by March 2026, and editorial work on the 2026 Yearbook completed by December 2026. Each annual cycle builds on the previous year's foundation: the 2027 conference would reach new audiences discovered through enhanced promotion in 2026; the digital infrastructure developed in 2026 would serve researchers for years; the Yearbook articles published in 2026 would inform legal and philosophical scholarship in 2027 and beyond.

For Anastasia in Almaty, this partnership means concrete transformation. She will present her research on legal standing for animal protection organizations at the 2026 conference, receiving feedback from international experts in real-time. She will publish her comparative analysis of Central Asian wildlife law in the 2026 Yearbook, contributing to the permanent intellectual record. She will access past conference recordings via the new digital platform when preparing lectures for her students. Most importantly, she will not work in isolation. She will be part of a growing community of Russian-speaking scholars and activists building the intellectual foundation for animal rights advocacy in their own cultural and legal contexts.

## Why This Partnership Advances Your Mission

The Culture & Animals Foundation has championed scholarship and artistic expression that reimagine human-animal relationships for over three decades. Your vision—that our future survival depends on developing a worldview embracing deep understanding of animals as deserving of our respect and care—requires intellectual infrastructure in every linguistic and cultural community. The Animal Law Workshop is that infrastructure for Russian-speaking communities.

Our four-year track record demonstrates capacity to deliver impact with minimal overhead. We have convened four annual conferences, published four Yearbook issues, developed two comprehensive 12-week online courses (animal ethics and animal law), and built a volunteer network spanning continents—all without external funding. This volunteer-powered model reflects the creativity, compassion, and commitment you seek to support, while ensuring that your investment directly advances consciousness-raising rather than subsidizing administrative costs.

Our commitment to animal rights philosophy—not welfare incrementalism—aligns precisely with your values. Conference presentations examine animals' intrinsic moral value, critique property-based legal frameworks, and explore rights-based alternatives. Yearbook articles engage Tom Regan's subjects-of-a-life framework, analyze legal personhood proposals, and interrogate speciesism in legal and philosophical traditions. Educational programming introduces students and early-career professionals to foundational animal rights theory. This is not a platform for "humane" agriculture reform or conservation biology; it is space for the rigorous intellectual work necessary for cultural transformation.

Our bilingual, international approach democratizes voice in animal advocacy. The English-language animal rights movement has advanced consciousness in powerful ways, but linguistic barriers have created inequity. Russian-speaking scholars and artists have been largely excluded from this discourse, unable to contribute their cultural perspectives or access existing scholarship. By creating genuinely bilingual intellectual space—not English content with occasional Russian summaries, but simultaneous interpretation and parallel publication—we ensure that animal rights philosophy develops with global input rather than remaining an English-language phenomenon.

Through your partnership, you would enable these measurable outcomes by December 2027:

**By May 2026**, launch a professional digital platform (animallawworkshop.org or similar domain) with searchable archive of past conference recordings, downloadable Yearbook articles, and educational resources, reaching a minimum of 150 monthly users within six months of launch.

**By October 2026**, convene the fifth annual international conference with 200+ registered participants from at least 15 countries, 50% from Russian-speaking communities in Eastern Europe, Central Asia, or diaspora, featuring 20+ presentations on animal rights philosophy, rights-based legal frameworks, and artistic expressions challenging cultural narratives about animals.

**By December 2026**, publish the 2026 Animal Law Yearbook with 20+ peer-reviewed bilingual articles advancing scholarship on animals' intrinsic rights, cultural roots of animal advocacy, and critiques of property-based legal frameworks, distributed digitally to 300+ subscribers and researchers.

**By May 2027**, expand promotional reach to achieve 40% growth in conference participation from 2026 baseline, with documented outreach to 50+ universities, legal associations, and animal advocacy organizations in underserved Russian-speaking regions.

**By December 2027**, demonstrate sustained intellectual community through post-conference collaborations: at minimum five joint research projects, two new institutional partnerships, and documented influence of conference scholarship on legal or advocacy initiatives in at least three countries.

The ripple effects extend far beyond these direct outcomes. When Russian-speaking legal scholars engage animal rights philosophy rigorously, they influence how future generations of lawyers and judges understand animals' moral status. When activists access bilingual scholarship on rights-based frameworks, they can reimagine advocacy strategies beyond welfare increments. When artists from underrepresented communities connect with international networks, they create new cultural language for animal rights. Your investment builds capacity for consciousness-raising that will compound over years and decades.

## The Investment: $5,000 to Build Lasting Infrastructure

We invite your partnership investment of **$5,000** to support the 2026–2027 conference cycle and infrastructure expansion. This represents the critical threshold funding necessary to professionalize the platform while maintaining our lean, volunteer-powered model.

Your investment would be allocated to maximize consciousness-raising impact:

**Digital Infrastructure ($1,200)**: Domain registration (two years), professional website design and development, hosting platform subscription, and technical support for archive migration. This one-time investment creates lasting access to scholarship.

**Bilingual Editorial Support ($1,800)**: Professional translation (English↔Russian) for conference promotional materials, session summaries, and key Yearbook articles; bilingual copyediting; layout design and digital publication production. This ensures intellectual rigor and accessibility.

**Simultaneous Interpretation ($1,400)**: Professional English-Russian interpretation for the 2026 conference's nine-hour program across multiple sessions, enabling real-time intellectual exchange and democratizing participation.

**Promotional Outreach ($600)**: Social media management (platform subscriptions, targeted advertising to academic and advocacy networks), promotional materials in both languages, participant communication tools, and strategic outreach coordination to universities and organizations in underserved regions.

No funding would support indirect costs, administrative overhead, or equipment purchases—aligning with your guidelines and our volunteer-powered model. Every dollar directly advances scholarship, consciousness-raising, or accessibility.

Sustainability is built into this approach. The digital infrastructure investment creates permanent capacity for discoverability and access. The expanded promotional reach in 2026 builds awareness that reduces outreach costs in future years. The editorial and interpretation investments ensure quality that strengthens the conference's reputation, attracting future participants and potential institutional partners. We are simultaneously pursuing complementary funding for educational program expansion (YouTube lecture series, legal guidance documents) and exploring potential institutional partnerships that could provide ongoing support beyond 2027.

Your $5,000 partnership investment would position the Animal Law Workshop as the recognized international convening platform for Russian-speaking animal rights scholarship—intellectual infrastructure that will serve this underrepresented community for years to come. You would be investing not in a single event, but in the foundation upon which scholars like Anastasia build rights-based legal frameworks, activists develop new advocacy strategies, and artists create cultural transformation.

We invite you to join us as partners in consciousness-raising. Together, we can ensure that the intellectual revolution in animal rights philosophy reaches every linguistic community, that scholarship on animals' intrinsic moral value develops with global voices, and that our nonhuman fellow creatures' rights are recognized across cultural and legal traditions. This is the infrastructure that makes transformation possible.

The work of awakening society to animals' deserving of our respect and care requires intellectual rigor, artistic excellence, and democratized access to scholarship. Your partnership would provide all three—in two languages, across fifteen countries, reaching hundreds of scholars and thousands of future advocates. This is how cultural transformation begins: one conference, one connection, one consciousness raised at a time.

### Funder Alignment Issues

Gaps to address: Artistic/creative components are mentioned but underdeveloped—need specific artists, artworks, or creative outputs expected; Missing science critique dimension that CAF emphasizes (AAVS Partnership Grants focus on reimagining scientific knowledge production); No mention of specific exhibitions, public performances, or arts presentations that CAF funds; Documentary media and visual work referenced generically without examples or featured artists; Lack of concrete creative deliverables vs. heavy emphasis on legal scholarship; No discussion of how conference challenges scientific treatment of animals as research subjects; Budget has no line items for artistic production, exhibition, or creative work support

Terminology overused (reduce frequency): intellectual infrastructure (appears 7 times), consciousness-raising (appears 6 times), partnership (appears 11 times), intellectual (appears 31 times), bilingual (appears 15 times), rigor/rigorous (appears 9 times), framework/frameworks (appears 18 times)

### Structural Fixes

REMOVE ENTIRELY: Opening anecdote about Anastasia needs to be condensed to 2-3 sentences maximum (currently 200+ words), All meta-commentary about what makes the proposal 'powerful' or 'transformative', Repetitive phrasing about 'intellectual infrastructure' and 'consciousness-raising', The entire final paragraph that restates the ask, Multiple outcome prediction paragraphs ('The ripple effects extend far beyond...')

ADD: Specific information about featured artists and their work, Examples of documentary films or visual art presented at past conferences, Connection to CAF's AAVS Partnership focus on critiquing/reimagining scientific knowledge production, Evidence of past impact (has conference scholarship influenced any legal changes, advocacy campaigns, or policy?), Names of other funders pursued or partnership conversations underway, Simple budget table format instead of paragraph descriptions, Risk assessment or what happens if conference doesn't get funding

### Priority Fixes (in order)

1. **AI rhetorical patterns dominate every paragraph**: Rewrite entirely in Daria's voice: direct, practical, less abstract. Remove all 'This is not X, it is Y' structures. Remove all em-dash emphasis. State facts plainly: 'The conference provides simultaneous interpretation' not 'This is not mere translation—it is the creation of shared intellectual space.' Cut word count by 40%.
2. **Opening story is generic AI narrative structure**: Either use a real person from the conference (with permission) and real details, or cut to 2-3 sentences: 'A legal scholar in Kazakhstan asked me where to find Russian-language scholarship on animal rights. There wasn't any. That's why we started the conference.' Make it personal and specific, not a constructed narrative arc.
3. **Artistic/creative component severely underdeveloped for CAF priorities**: Add specific section on creative work presented at conferences. Name 2-3 artists who've participated, describe their documentary films or visual work. Explain how conference creates space for artists alongside scholars. Add budget line item ($400-500) for supporting artist presentations or creative documentation. This is critical for CAF fit.
4. **Missing science critique angle that CAF emphasizes**: Add 1 paragraph connecting to CAF's AAVS Partnership focus: Has the conference addressed how Russian/Soviet scientific traditions treated animals as research subjects? Have scholars presented on reimagining veterinary science or wildlife biology? This is a major CAF funding category currently absent.
5. **Overuse of 'intellectual infrastructure' and abstract terminology**: Replace every instance of 'intellectual infrastructure' with concrete specifics: 'website where scholars find past presentations,' 'interpreters who make the conference accessible,' 'journal that publishes their research.' Remove words like 'catalyze,' 'consciousness-raising,' 'transformation' except when absolutely necessary. Use simple verbs.
6. **No evidence of past impact beyond growth numbers**: Add 3-4 specific examples of conference impact: 'Scholar X cited conference presentation in published article on Y.' 'Activist Z used conference connections to launch campaign in [country].' 'University W now includes Yearbook article in syllabus.' If these don't exist yet, acknowledge early stage but describe realistic pathways to impact.
7. **Budget presented as prose instead of clear table**: Create simple table: Item | Amount | Purpose. Remove all justification language ('This is not administrative overhead...'). Let the budget speak for itself. If the funder questions it, they'll ask. Add one sentence about sustainability plan: are you pursuing other funders, institutional partnerships, or eventual fee model?

### Content to Preserve

Keep these elements that work well: The specific request amount: $5,000; Growth data: 70-100% annual participant growth; Geographic scope: Eastern Europe, Central Asia, diaspora communities; Concrete outputs: 4 annual conferences, 4 Yearbook issues, 2 online courses; Volunteer-powered model (demonstrates efficiency); Bilingual simultaneous interpretation (unique value proposition); Timeline details: May-October 2026 conference cycle; Specific outcomes with numbers: 200+ participants, 15 countries, 20+ presentations; Domain name investment as lasting infrastructure; Tom Regan reference and 'subjects-of-a-life' framework; Reference to habeas corpus petitions for elephants (concrete legal example); Budget breakdown categories (just reformat as table)
