# FUNDER INTELLIGENCE (EXTRACT FROM ATTACHED FILES)
# ========================================

From the Grant Evaluation file, extract and use:

- **Funder's Mission & Vision**: [Use to align proposal language]
- **Funder's Core Values**: [Mirror these throughout the proposal]
- **Funder's Strategic Priorities**: [Ensure project addresses these]
- **Key Language/Keywords to Mirror**: [Use these exact terms in the proposal]
- **Thematic Focus**: [Align project description with these themes]
- **Target Groups**: [Ensure project serves appropriate populations]
- **Geographic Focus**: [Confirm geographic alignment]
- **Evaluation Criteria**: [Address each criterion in the proposal]
- **Red Flags/Considerations**: [Acknowledge and address these]

==================================================
CORE PRINCIPLES (FOLLOW STRICTLY)
==================================================

**PRINCIPLE 1: DONOR-CENTRICITY**
- This is NOT a request for money. It's an INVITATION to partnership.
- Use "you-centric" language: "Your investment enables...", "This partnership allows you to...", "Through your support..."
- Frame everything around what the FUNDER gets to accomplish, not what "we need"
- The funder is the HERO of this story - they have the power to create change

**PRINCIPLE 2: STORY-FIRST APPROACH**
Use the P.A.S.T. → P.A.T.H. → P.O.W.E.R. narrative framework:

P.A.S.T. (The Problem Story)
- P: Present a specific, vivid PROBLEM
- A: Introduce an ARCHETYPE character (a real person experiencing this problem)
- S: Describe their current SITUATION in human terms
- T: Show the TRAJECTORY if nothing changes

P.A.T.H. (The Solution Journey)
- P: Present the PROPOSED solution
- A: Detail the ACTIVITIES that will transform lives
- T: Provide concrete TIMELINE and milestones
- H: Show HOW this specifically helps the archetype

P.O.W.E.R. (The Partnership Ask)
- P: Frame this as a PARTNERSHIP invitation
- O: State measurable OUTCOMES (SMART objectives)
- W: Emphasize WHAT the funder enables
- E: Show EXPECTED ripple effects beyond direct beneficiaries
- R: Specify RESOURCES requested and their impact

**PRINCIPLE 3: SPECIFICITY IS CREDIBILITY**
- Use real names, places, and numbers (from the attached organization profile)
- Avoid generic phrases like "holistic approach" or "community-driven"
- Every claim should be backed by evidence or specific example
- SMART objectives: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound

**PRINCIPLE 4: MIRROR THE FUNDER'S LANGUAGE**
- Use terminology from funder's materials (extracted from Grant Evaluation file)
- Echo their strategic priorities in your narrative
- Align with their theory of change

==================================================
PROPOSAL GENERATION TASK
==================================================

Generate a complete grant proposal with the following sections. Each section should be ready to submit (not placeholders or templates).

**PROPOSAL STRUCTURE**:

Write a flowing, cohesive grant proposal document in markdown format. The proposal should read as a smooth narrative - NOT artificially broken into rigid sections with heavy headers. 

The narrative should naturally weave together:

1. **Opening Hook** - Start with a compelling human story (the archetype character). Create a composite person with a name who represents who this project serves. Write their story naturally - who they are, their struggles, and their hopes. This should immediately capture the reader's heart.

2. **The Challenge** - Flow naturally from the human story into the broader problem. Use data to contextualize, but keep the human element central. Show why this matters NOW and connect to funder's concerns.

3. **The Solution** - Present your approach as a hypothesis: "We believe that if we [action], then [outcome]". Show how this transforms lives. Include specific activities and timeline woven into the narrative.

4. **Why This Partnership** - Establish credibility through story, not lists. Show your track record through examples. Frame as a partnership invitation. Include 3-5 measurable outcomes (SMART objectives) naturally within the text.

5. **The Investment** - Tell the story behind the budget. Link costs to outcomes. Address sustainability. End with a clear, compelling ask.

**IMPORTANT WRITING GUIDELINES**:
- Use markdown formatting (headers, bold, lists) sparingly and only where they genuinely aid readability
- Avoid rigid "Section 1, Section 2" structures - let ideas flow naturally
- Use ## headers only for major transitions, not for every topic
- The proposal should feel like it was written by a skilled human writer, not generated
- Total length: 2,000-3,000 words
